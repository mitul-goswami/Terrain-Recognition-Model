## 🚀 **Features**

✅ **Accurate Terrain Classification** – Identifies grassy, rocky, sandy, and marshy terrains.  
✅ **Deep Learning Approach** – Utilizes a customized **CNN** for feature extraction and classification.  
✅ **High Performance** – Achieves **92% accuracy** in real-world datasets.  
✅ **Customizable** – Easily adaptable to other terrain datasets.

## 🗂️ **Dataset**

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled terrain images:

- 🌿 **Grassy**: Green and vegetative landscapes.  
- 🪨 **Rocky**: Rugged, stone-covered terrains.  
- 🏖️ **Sandy**: Soft, loose sandy areas.  
- 🌊 **Marshy**: Wetlands and marsh-covered regions.  

**Note:** The dataset is not provided due to licensing constraints, but you can adapt your dataset by organizing it in class-wise folders.

## 🧠 **Model Architecture**

The **Terrain Recognition Model** is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.

**Model Flow:**

1. **Input Layer** – Accepts images of shape **224x224** pixels.
2. **Convolutional Layers** – Extracts key features using multiple convolution operations with **ReLU activation**.
3. **Pooling Layers** – Reduces dimensionality using **MaxPooling**.
4. **Fully Connected Layer** – Classifies the image into one of the terrain categories.
5. **Output Layer** – Outputs probabilities using **Softmax** activation.
